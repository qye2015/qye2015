% Function to deploy macro and pico BSs
% a center 7-hex-cell and wrap around
% 
% ===================================================
% Inputs:
%   BS:     (nB*2 matrix)       the BS locations
%   nm:     (number)            # of macro BSs
%   
%   L: 	(number)            # of layers, where each layer is consisted of a 7-hex-cell
% ===================================================
% Outputs:
%   D:      (nB*nU matrix)      the distance between BS and UE
